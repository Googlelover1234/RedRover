Currently unfinished!

There is quite a bit of work needed to finish this project, but as I really hope to make it something that'll be a lot of fun for players and easily configurable for server admins.

In the future it'll look something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDxY02O_7MU

Some other ideas I have for it:

  * Nice graphical effects - One thing I've already started working on that I think will be nice is the floor color changing.
  * Multi-arena support - Already being worked on, hopefully this will allow bigger servers to use it without resorting to one arena           filled with ~30-50 players.
  * Powerful API - Not the most important thing to add to this plugin, but it would be nice if developers could modify mechanics of the       gamemode with their own plugin
  
The code in this plugin is under GPL v3.0, meaning you can add your own modifications to the source code and distribute it. Please keep in mind: you must release the source code to any alternate distributions that you give out (even if you are selling it!).
  
I'm always happy to review pull requests and listen to feedback from people, so if you have ideas, feel free to contact me at BukkitDev or Spigot if you wish!
